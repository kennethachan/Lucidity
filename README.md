### **_Description_**

#### For my Unit 2 project I propose to create a "lofi - anime" inspired productivity page. There has been a strong popularity in youtube livestreams featuring lofi hip hop/slowed and reverbed mixes with anime as the visual. Many people have used these playlists to help them study or work on tedious tasks. I wanted to bring this together and create a page that lets the user choose a GIF and music to create a relaxing/positive environment to be productive or decompress and write down whats on their mind.

### **_MVP_**

#### The user is greeted with a landing page to either login or register. To register, the user will need to input an email address and a password. After registering/logging in the user will enter the homepage.

#### The homepage has (3) main features:

#### -In the center will be a static slideshow with anime GIFs to choose from. You will be able to click and arrow to move back and forth between the GIFs depending on your mood.

#### -To the right will be a notepad that has full CRUD operations. The note pad will be able to be scrollable so a plethra of notes can be be made without taking too much of the screen.

#### -To the left will be the audio component. The user will be able to choose from a pre-selected music selection to help them concentrate/relax while focusing on their tasks.
